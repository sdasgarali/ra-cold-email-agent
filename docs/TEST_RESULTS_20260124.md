## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Route Ordering Bug
**Severity:** High
**Modules Affected:** Leads, Contacts, Clients
**Description:** Static routes like `/stats` were being matched by dynamic routes `/{id}` due to route ordering
**Root Cause:** FastAPI processes routes in order; `/{id}` was defined before `/stats`
**Fix:** Moved `/stats` routes before `/{id}` routes in all affected modules
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/leads.py`
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/contacts.py`
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/clients.py`

### Issue 2: Invalid Enum Values in Tests
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Test scripts used invalid LeadStatus values ("contacted", "qualified")
**Root Cause:** Test data didn't match enum definition
**Fix:** Updated test values to valid statuses ("enriched", "validated")
**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/comprehensive_test.py`

### Issue 3: Inconsistent API Response Format
**Severity:** Medium
**Modules Affected:** Contacts, Clients
**Description:** List endpoints returned raw list instead of paginated object
**Fix:** Updated to return `{items: [], total: N}` format for consistency
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/contacts.py`
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/clients.py`

## Recommendations

1. **Test Data Isolation:** Integration tests should use separate test database or cleanup fixtures
2. **CI/CD Integration:** Add comprehensive_test.py to CI pipeline
3. **Load Testing:** Consider adding load tests for production deployment
4. **Monitoring:** Implement API health checks and metrics
