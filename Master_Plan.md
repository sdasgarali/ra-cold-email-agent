# Master Plan - Exzelon RA Cold-Email Automation System

## Vision
Fully automated cold-email outreach system for Exzelon Research Analysts targeting non-IT industries (manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, etc.). The system discovers job postings, enriches contacts, validates emails, and manages outreach campaigns with enterprise-grade mailbox warmup and deliverability management.

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Backend framework | FastAPI | Async, auto OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation |
| Frontend framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) | SSR, React ecosystem, Tailwind integration |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 | Mature, supports SQLite + MySQL seamlessly |
| Auth | JWT (7-day expiry) + Argon2 | bcrypt had Windows compatibility issues |
| External integrations | Adapter pattern with base classes | Swap providers without changing pipeline logic |
| AI content | Multi-provider (Groq/OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini) | Flexibility, fallback options |
| State management | Zustand + TanStack Query | Lightweight global state + server cache |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + Lucide icons | Utility-first, accessible primitives |
| Charts | Recharts | React-native, composable, lightweight |
| Task scheduling | APScheduler (BackgroundScheduler) | In-process, no external deps for dev |
| Dev DB | SQLite (file-based) | Zero setup for local development |
| Prod DB | MySQL 8 (via Docker) | Robust, widely deployed |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Email deliverability (bounces > 2%) | Account suspension | Multi-layer validation, warmup engine, blacklist monitoring |
| API rate limits (JSearch, Apollo) | Pipeline stalls | Configurable delays, retry logic, multiple source fallback |
| Provider API changes | Broken integrations | Adapter pattern isolates each provider behind interface |
| Mailbox reputation damage | Emails go to spam | Conservative warmup profiles, DNS health checks, daily limits |
| Data quality (stale leads) | Wasted outreach | Deduplication, salary threshold, industry/role filtering |
| Single point of failure (SQLite) | Data loss | MySQL for production, regular backups recommended |

---

## Key Business Rules
- Daily send limit: 30 emails per mailbox
- Cooldown: 10 days between emails to same contact
- Max 4 contacts per company per job
- Salary threshold: 0k+ minimum
- 22 non-IT target industries; IT roles and US staffing agencies excluded
- Only contacts with "Valid" email status receive outreach
- Contact priority: P1 (job poster) > P2 (HR/TA) > P3 (HR manager) > P4 (ops leader) > P5 (functional manager)
